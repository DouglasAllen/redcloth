h2. Installing RedCloth

To install RedCloth via raa-install:

  raa-install -i redcloth

Or download RedCloth and simply run the install.rb like so:

<code>
  ruby install.rb config
  ruby install.rb setup
  sudo ruby install.rb install
</code>


h2. Using RedCloth

The RedCloth class is an extension of Ruby's String class.
Use it like you would a String:

<code>
  >> r = RedCloth.new "*strong text* and _emphasized text_"
  => "*strong text* and _emphasized text_"
  >> r.gsub!( 'text', 'words' )
  => "*strong words* and _emphasized words_"
</code>

To generate HTML from your RedCloth object, use the
@RedCloth#to_html@ method:

<code>
  >> r.to_html
  => "<p><strong>strong words</strong> and <em>emphasized words</em></p>"
</code>
