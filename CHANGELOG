= RedCloth 4.0
=== 15th Feb, 2007

* New SuperRedCloth (RedCloth 4.0) is a total rewrite using Ragel for the parsing.
* Markdown support has been removed.
* Single newlines become <br> tags, just as in traditional RedCloth and other Textile parsers.
* The restrictions parameter is observed just like previous versions (except :hard_breaks is now the default).
* Arguments to to_html are called so extensions from the versions are compatible.
* Custom block tags can be implemented as in the previous version, though the means of implementing them differs.
* HTML embedded in the Textile input does not often need to be escaped from Textile parsing.
* The parser will skip lines that begin with a space.
* Rudimentary support for LaTeX is built in.
* Output (less newlines and tabs) is identical to Textile 2 except a few cases where the RedCloth
  way was preferable.
* RedCloth::VERSION on a line by itself inserts the version number into the output.
* Oh yeah... and it's 40 times faster than the previous version.
